### Description

This code is intended as a replacement shell for Windows. It contains the functions that many people use.
 
### More Info
 
An error message will pop up stating that a background picture needs to be set. Click the Windows Menu and go to Options - it's self-explanatory from there.

You need to make sure you are running in 1024x768 resolution with 16 or 24 bit color. The icons look ugly in 32 bit color.

Notes about Evergreen Shell 2.1:

* The "Start" menu at the bottom is not fully completed. 

* The Task Manager functionality is sketchy. Try it - if it works, great.

* You need Internet Explorer 5.0 with the Windows Common Controls  6.0.

* If the icons look ugly, exit VB and set your display to 800 X 600 16bit or 24 bit color.

* Next release: the ugly Text box at the top is done away with forever! New RUN support
is on the way!!!

* The Shutdown box doesn't work yet - 2.1 SR4 or 5 should have full functionality.
Remind me to post it if it's not up by Feb 18.

* If you want a decent-looking background picture for Evergreen Shell, check out the
snowman.jpg included in the zip file. Just make sure to set it as the background in Options.
